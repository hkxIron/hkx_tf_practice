"In this notebook, we'll build a model that takes in a sequence of letters, and outputs a sorted version of that sequence. We'll do that using what we've learned so far about Sequence to Sequence models. This notebook was updated to work with TensorFlow 1.1 and builds on the work of Dave Currie.

" - Dense output layer ",

"### Process Decoder Input ",
" ",
" ",
"In the training process, the target sequences will be used in two different places: ",
" ",
" 1. Using them to calculate the loss ",
" 2. Feeding them to the decoder during training to make the model more robust. ",
" ",
"Now we need to address the second point. Let's assume our targets look like this in their letter/word form (we're doing this for readibility. At this point in the code, these sequences would be in int form): ",
" ",
" ",
"<img src="images/targets_1.png"/> ",
" ",
"We need to do a simple transformation on the tensor before feeding it to the decoder: ",
" ",
"1- We will feed an item of the sequence to the decoder at each time step. Think about the last timestep -- where the decoder outputs the final word in its output. The input to that step is the item before last from the target sequence. The decoder has no use for the last item in the target sequence in this scenario. So we'll need to remove the last item. ",
" ",
"We do that using tensorflow's tf.strided_slice() method. We hand it the tensor, and the index of where to start and where to end the cutting. ",
" ",
"<img src="images/strided_slice_1.png"/> ",
" ",
"2- The first item in each sequence we feed to the decoder has to be GO symbol. So We'll add that to the beginning. ",
" ",
" ",
"<img src="images/targets_add_go.png"/> ",
" ",
" ",

"Now that we have prepared the inputs to the training decoder, we need to embed them so they can be ready to be passed to the decoder. ",
" ",
"We'll create an embedding matrix like the following then have tf.nn.embedding_lookup convert our input to its embedded equivalent: ",
"<img src="images/embeddings.png" /> ",
" ",
"#### 2- Decoder Cell ",
"Then we declare our decoder cell. Just like the encoder, we'll use an tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMCell here as well. ",
" ",
"We need to declare a decoder for the training process, and a decoder for the inference/prediction process. These two decoders will share their parameters (so that all the weights and biases that are set during the training phase can be used when we deploy the model). ",
" ",
"First, we'll need to define the type of cell we'll be using for our decoder RNNs. We opted for LSTM. ",
" ",
"#### 3- Dense output layer ",
"Before we move to declaring our decoders, we'll need to create the output layer, which will be a tensorflow.python.layers.core.Dense layer that translates the outputs of the decoder to logits that tell us which element of the decoder vocabulary the decoder is choosing to output at each time step. ",
" ",
"#### 4- Training decoder ",
"Essentially, we'll be creating two decoders which share their parameters. One for training and one for inference. The two are similar in that both created using tf.contrib.seq2seq.**BasicDecoder** and tf.contrib.seq2seq.**dynamic_decode**. They differ, however, in that we feed the the target sequences as inputs to the training decoder at each time step to make it more robust. ",
" ",
"We can think of the training decoder as looking like this (except that it works with sequences in batches): ",
"<img src="images/sequence-to-sequence-training-decoder.png"/> ",
" ",
"The training decoder **does not** feed the output of each time step to the next. Rather, the inputs to the decoder time steps are the target sequence from the training dataset (the orange letters). ",
" ",
"#### 5- Inference decoder ",
"The inference decoder is the one we'll use when we deploy our model to the wild. ",
" ",
"<img src="images/sequence-to-sequence-inference-decoder.png"/> ",
" ",
"We'll hand our encoder hidden state to both the training and inference decoders and have it process its output. TensorFlow handles most of the logic for us. We just have to use the appropriate methods from tf.contrib.seq2seq and supply them with the appropriate inputs. "
